## üßæ Project Overview

### üåü Introduction

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a rapidly evolving, non-invasive imaging modality that combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. It has garnered significant interest across various fields, including biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, and preclinical studies, due to its ability to provide detailed images of biological tissues and structures without the use of ionizing radiation.

### üöÄ Objectives

The primary goal of the **PAID (Photoacoustic Imaging Dataset)** repository is to serve as a centralized, up-to-date, and comprehensive resource for researchers, clinicians, and students interested in PAI. This repository aims to:

- **Curate and Organize**: Collect and systematically organize all publicly available datasets related to photoacoustic imaging, ensuring that users have access to a wide range of data sources in one place.
- **Support Research**: Facilitate the advancement of research in PAI by providing a diverse set of datasets that can be used for algorithm development, validation, and benchmarking.
- **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration among the PAI community by making data accessible and easy to share, thereby fostering innovation and the development of new applications.
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as an educational tool for students and newcomers to the field, offering a variety of datasets to learn and experiment with.

### üìö Dataset Categories

The datasets included in this repository cover a broad spectrum of PAI techniques and applications, such as:

- **Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM)**: High-resolution imaging of small-scale biological structures, often used for studying cellular and sub-cellular processes.
- **Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT)**: Whole-body or large-scale imaging, suitable for visualizing organs and tissues in vivo.
- **Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging**: Datasets that capture multiple wavelengths of light to provide detailed information about different tissue types and their properties.

We experimentally demonstrate the method with phantom and in vivo experiments using an integrated photoacoustic probe. We also compare the method with elevational transducer array displacement and take into account the sensitivity of the transducer array in the 3D reconstruction.  | [Download](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/ce7b7a42-2268-4c4c-9b00-75e55c8eca74/1) |
