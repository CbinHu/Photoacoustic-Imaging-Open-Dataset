# 📚 PAID: Photoacoustic Imaging Dataset

**A Comprehensive Repository for Photoacoustic Imaging Datasets**

---


## 🌟 Project Overview

### 🎯 Introduction

Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) is a cutting-edge, non-invasive imaging modality that merges the high contrast of optical imaging with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. It has become a cornerstone in biomedical research, clinical diagnostics, and preclinical studies, offering detailed, radiation-free imaging of biological tissues and structures.

### 📚 Objectives

The **PAID (Photoacoustic Imaging Dataset)** repository is designed to be a comprehensive, up-to-date, and centralized resource for researchers, clinicians, and students interested in PAI. Our goals are:

- **Curate and Organize**: Aggregate and systematically categorize all publicly available datasets related to photoacoustic imaging.
- **Support Research**: Provide a diverse set of datasets to facilitate algorithm development, validation, and benchmarking.
- **Promote Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration within the PAI community by making data accessible and easy to share.
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as an educational tool for students and newcomers to the field, offering a variety of datasets for learning and experimentation.

### 📊 Dataset Categories

Our repository includes datasets across various PAI techniques and applications, such as:

- **Photoacoustic Microscopy (PAM)**: High-resolution imaging for studying cellular and sub-cellular processes.
- **Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT)**: Whole-body or large-scale imaging for visualizing organs and tissues in vivo.
- **Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging**: Datasets capturing multiple wavelengths to provide detailed information about tissue types and properties.
